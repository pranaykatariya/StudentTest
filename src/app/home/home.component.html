                  <p class="test-tip__body">This advice sounds repeated and old, but it is a true fact. The more you practice, the more likely you will succeed. The key is to take as many practice tests as you can before the actual test so that you are prepared enough and feel confident on the day of your exam. Practice tests will help you assess your weak points so that you can focus on them and improve them. It will also help you to manage time so you have enough time to answer the whole test.</p>

                  <p class="test-tip__body">There's no excuse for not being equipped before your tests. Ensure you have a good calculator, a few pens, pencils, and some draft paper. Do not forget to wear a watch so you can manage your time too. Practice using your equipment before attempting the actual test to make sure everything works perfectly and you give yourself the best chance of passing.</p>

                  <p class="test-tip__body">You are usually given a sample test question before the test starts. Make good use of it, assess the type of question asked, and review the format. This way, once the real test starts, there will be no unexpected surprises.</p>

                  <p class="test-tip__body">Before you start the test, read the instructions given on it carefully. Crucially note how much time you have and how many questions there are. This allows you to work out how long you have for each question so you can pace yourself accordingly.</p>

                  <p class="test-tip__body">If you have trouble solving a question, then move on. It's important not to fret too much and waste a bunch of time on a single question. There is a possibility that you'll find the following questions easier so move on and let yourself tackle them. Plus, if you have time later on, you can always go back to the question you were stuck on.</p>
